            <h3>Beginning of our<span class="love">‚ù§</span></h3>
            <p><span class="upper">First we both were strangers. For the first time we met on Facebook. You knew me but I didn't, your motive for me was different, mine was simple. Wanna know my motive  &#128514;, being the dumb girl I was,I thought everyone who is a friend in facebook was actually my friend. So when you asked to meet i said okay because I thought you were my friend. We both came with different motives to see eachother. But when we saw eachother, everything fade away. You became clear you want me. I wasn't sure what am was gonna do. But you know one thing, from that day onwards I started to blend inside you. I may not know or feel it that time, but now I know. I was the most luckiest dumbo and stupid girl ever who met you, moreover because was you liked me and besides every other girl you knew you chose me.</span> <span class="lower">Thank you so much&#x2763;.
            And then the story begins........

            I just want you to know baba we've been together in the hardest times. I know it was my fault, but our relationship was tied up with a thin strand or not but even that was too strong to break us.</span></p>
